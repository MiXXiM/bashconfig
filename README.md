# bashconfig
Bash configuration files I created to use and share.

This .bashrc file (meant to go into $HOME/) is something I've enjoyed working on here and there since I got into Linux and shell programming. It's gone through so very many stages, improving as my shell and Linux knowledge improved.

The file is not meant to be used as-is, so be sure to make the necessary changes so that it is functional for you.

The main thing you'll want to change is the location of your function library (or files you're okay being sourced by .bashrc), and to enter into the for loop the files you wish to be sourced, many of which I've written I will provide here, as I find some of them very useful and can see others finding the same.

If you have any issues or recommendations, for .bashrc or for anything else you see here, please let me know.

CAUTION:

Some of this code is meant to be looked at by you and customized to fit your needs. I'm just supplying my personal configuration, while also keeping in mind that others might want to use it. So, with this in mind, I'm expecting some prior shell knowledge, or at least some experience looking at code.

Some things are still a work in progress, perhaps even abandoned or forgotten, such as the odd ShellPlugins.
